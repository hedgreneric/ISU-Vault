## Question 3.6
**Give an algorithm that computes in O(n log n) time a diagonal that splits a simple polygon with n vertices into two simple polygons each with at most ⌊2n/3⌋ + 2 vertices. Hint: Use the dual graph of a triangulation.**





## Question 3.7
**Let P be a simple polygon with n vertices, which has been partitioned into monotone pieces. Prove that the sum of the number of vertices of the pieces is O(n).



## Question 4.2
**Consider the casting problem in the plane: we are given polygon P and a 2-dimensional mold for it. Describe a linear time algorithm that decides whether P can be removed from the mold by a single translation.**



## Question 4.8
**The plane z = 1 can be used to represent all directions of vectors in 3-dimensional space that have a positive z-value. How can we represent all directions of vectors in 3-dimensional space that have a non-negative z-value? And how can we represent the directions of all vectors in 3-dimensional space?**



## Question 4.10
**Let H be a set of at least three half-planes with a non-empty intersection such that not all bounding lines are parallel. We call a half-plane h ∈ H redundant if it does not contribute an edge to 􏰅 H . Prove that for any redundant half-plane h ∈ H there are two half-planes h′ , h′′ ∈ H such that h′ ∩ h′′ ⊂ h. Give an O(n log n) time algorithm to compute all redundant half-planes.
