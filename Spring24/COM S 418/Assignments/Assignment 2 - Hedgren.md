## Question 2.5
**Which of the following equalities are always true?** 
1. **Twin(Twin(⃗e)) = ⃗e**                                           Always true
2. **Next(Prev(⃗e)) = ⃗e**                                           Always true
3. **Twin(Prev(Twin(⃗e))) = Next(⃗e)**                       Not always true
4. **IncidentFace(⃗e) = IncidentFace(Next(⃗e))**      Always true

## Question 2.9
**Suppose that a doubly-connected edge list of a connected subdivision is given. Give pseudocode for an algorithm that lists all faces with vertices that appear on the outer boundary.**

## Question 2.12
 **Let S be a set of n triangles in the plane. The boundaries of the triangles are disjoint, but it is possible that a triangle lies completely inside another triangle. Let P be a set of n points in the plane. Give an O(n log n) algorithm that reports each point in P lying outside all triangles.** 

## Question 2.14
**Let S be a set of n disjoint line segments in the plane, and let p be a point not on any of the line segments of S. We wish to determine all line segments of S that p can see, that is, all line segments of S that  contain some point q so that the open segment pq doesn’t intersect any p  not visible line segment of S. Give an O(n log n) time algorithm for this problem that uses a rotating half-line with its endpoint at p.**

## Question 3.2
**A rectilinear polygon is a simple polygon of which all edges are horizontal  or vertical. Let P be a rectilinear polygon with n vertices. Give an example to show that  ⌊n/4⌋ cameras are sometimes necessary to guard it. **
