- To reduce the sorting problem to the convex hull problem, we can use the following transformation: given n numbers x1, x2, …, xn to sort, we form n points in the plane (xi, xi^2) for i = 1, 2, …, n. These points lie on the parabola y = x^2, which is convex. Therefore, all the points are on the convex hull of the set, and the counterclockwise ordering of the points on the hull is precisely the values in ascending order. Thus, if we can compute the convex hull of these points in O(f(n)) time, then we can sort the numbers in O(n + f(n)) time, by reading off the x-coordinates of the hull vertices. This transformation takes O(n) time, so the cost of solving the sorting problem is O(n) plus the cost of solving the convex hull problem.
- To show that this reduction implies that the convex hull problem has a lower bound of Ω(n log n) in the comparison-based model of computation, we can use the following argument: suppose that there exists an algorithm that can solve the convex hull problem in O(f(n)) time, where f(n) is o(n log n), which means that f(n) grows asymptotically slower than n log n. Then, by using the reduction above, we can sort n numbers in O(n + f(n)) time, which is also o(n log n). This contradicts the well-known lower bound of Ω(n log n) for the sorting problem in the comparison-based model of computation, which means that any algorithm that sorts n numbers must take at least n log n steps in the worst case, regardless of the implementation details. Therefore, such an algorithm for the convex hull problem cannot exist, and the convex hull problem also has a lower bound of Ω(n log n) in the comparison-based model of computation.
