## Question 7.1
**Prove that for any n > 3 there is a set of n point sites in the plane such that one of the cells of Vor(P) has n − 1 vertices.**



## Question 7.2
**Show that Theorem 7.3 implies that the average number of vertices of a Voronoi cell is less than six.**



## Question 7.3
**Show that Ω(n log n) is a lower bound for computing Voronoi diagrams by reducing the sorting problem to the problem of computing Voronoi diagrams. You can assume that the Voronoi diagram algorithm should be able to compute for every vertex of the Voronoi diagram its incident edges in cyclic order around the vertex.**
