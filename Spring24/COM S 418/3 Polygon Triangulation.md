**Simple polygon** - region enclosed by a single polygonal chain that does not intersect itself

to simplify this problem we can break this polygon into triangles. Do so by creating triangles and adding a diagonals (line segment between two vertices within the shape).

3-coloring

Instead of putting a camera in every triangle or on every diagonal we can use almost n/3 cameras. There are 3 color (white, gray, black). Each vertices that share a diagonal or edge are colored differently.
