seq_num - order in which character is added to world (used for tie breakers of next_turn)

next_turn - use min heap for getting symbol with smallest next_turn, after add the next terrain to next_turn for that symbol

reset Discrete Event Simulator after switching maps

add character map layer - 2d array of pointers pointing to characters otherwise its NULL

qsort in stdlib for sorting
